% Linear Multivariable Control
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% (a) Design a state-feedback controller to place the eigenvalues along the real axis between
% -3 and -8 with imaginary components less than + or - j
% (b) Construct an observer (open or closed-loop) to implement the state feedback
% (c) Find the model for the entire system â€“ including the observer and feedback
